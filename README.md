# Performance Testing Using JMeter & JMX Files

1. What is JMeter?
Apache JMeter is an open-source tool used for performance, load, and stress testing of web applications, APIs, and databases.

2. What is a JMX File?
A JMX file is an XML-based file that stores JMeter test plans, including test scenarios, samplers, listeners, and configurations.

3. Steps for Performance Testing Using JMeter
Install JMeter – Download and install from the Apache JMeter website.
Create a Test Plan – Add Thread Groups, HTTP Requests, and Listeners.
Configure Load Parameters – Define users, ramp-up time, and loops.
Save as JMX File – Stores all test configurations.
Run the Test – Execute using JMeter GUI or CLI (jmeter -n -t testplan.jmx -l result.jtl).
Analyze Results – Review response times, throughput, and error rates using Listeners or reports.
